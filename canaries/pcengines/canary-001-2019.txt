3. PC Engines Open Source Firmware Release 4.9 Signing Key is signed

4. No warrants have ever been served to us with regard to the PC Engines

backdoors).

two weeks of August 2019. Special note should be taken if no new canary

plausible explanation.

Disclaimers and notes
----------------------

We would like to remind you that PC Engines firmware is being released
under the assumption that all relevant infrastructure is permanently
compromised.  This means that we assume NO trust in any of the servers
or services which host or provide any PC Engines firmware-related data,
in particular, firmware updates, source code repositories, and firmware
downloads.

This canary scheme is not infallible. Although signing the declaration
makes it very difficult for a third party to produce arbitrary
declarations, it does not prevent them from using force or other
means, like blackmail or compromising the signers' laptops, to coerce
us to produce false declarations.

The news feeds quoted below (Proof of freshness) serves to demonstrate
that this canary could not have been created prior to the date stated.
It shows that a series of canaries was not created in advance.

This declaration is merely a best effort and is provided without any
guarantee or warranty. It is not legally binding in any way to
anybody. None of the signers should be ever held legally responsible
for any of the statements made here.
