                ---===[ PC Engines Canary #4 ]===---


Statements
-----------

The 3mdeb firmware developers who have digitally signed this file [1]
state the following:

1. The date of issue of this canary is June 18, 2020.

2. The reason of the early canary release is the mistake replicated in each
previous canary. The 3mdeb Master Signing Key fingerprint was mistaken with 
PC Engines Open Source Firmware Release 4.9 Signing Key fingerprint.

3. The 3mdeb Master Signing Key fingerprint is:

    1B57 85C2 965D 84CF 85D1  652B 4AFD 81D9 7BD3 7C54

4. The 3mdeb Open Source Firmware Master Key fingerprint is:

    EA61 CBAD DA1C 094A 2540  E596 028A 7527 64CB 97EC

5. PC Engines Open Source Firmware Release 4.12 Signing Key is signed
by 3mdeb Open Source Firmware Master Key, which is signed by 3mdeb
Master Key.

6. No warrants have ever been served to us with regard to the PC Engines
firmware (e.g. to hand out the private signing keys or to introduce
backdoors).

7. We plan to publish the next of these canary statements in the first
two weeks of November 2020. Special note should be taken if no new canary
is published by that time or if the list of statements changes without
plausible explanation.

8. Due to new coreboot 4.12 release the PC Engines firmware binaries are
going to be signed with PC Engines Open Source Firmware Release 4.12
Signing Key with following fingerprint:

    A5B6 4D59 EFDD 7BAB 8BAB  D60B 2AE0 58A9 E984 9FA4

9. The PC Engines firmware versions beginning from v4.0.31 and v4.12.0.1
are being signed with PC Engines Open Source Firmware Release 4.12 Signing
Key unless a new official coreboot release is announced. New coreboot
release should follow a new key generation, which public signature should
be available on 3mdeb-secpack repository.


Disclaimers and notes
----------------------

We would like to remind you that PC Engines firmware is being released
under the assumption that all relevant infrastructure is permanently
compromised.  This means that we assume NO trust in any of the servers
or services which host or provide any PC Engines firmware-related data,
in particular, firmware updates, source code repositories, and firmware
downloads.

This canary scheme is not infallible. Although signing the declaration
makes it very difficult for a third party to produce arbitrary
declarations, it does not prevent them from using force or other
means, like blackmail or compromising the signers' laptops, to coerce
us to produce false declarations.

The news feeds quoted below (Proof of freshness) serves to demonstrate
that this canary could not have been created prior to the date stated.
It shows that a series of canaries was not created in advance.

This declaration is merely a best effort and is provided without any
guarantee or warranty. It is not legally binding in any way to
anybody. None of the signers should be ever held legally responsible
for any of the statements made here.
