The 3mdeb firmware developers who have digitally signed this file [1]
state the following:

1. The date of issue of this canary is {issue_date}.

2. The 3mdeb Master Signing Key fingerprint is:

backdoors).

6. We plan to publish the next of these canary statements in the first
two weeks of July 2020. Special note should be taken if no new canary
is published by that time or if the list of statements changes without
plausible explanation.

7. Due to new coreboot 4.11 release the PC Engines firmware binaries are
going to be signed with PC Engines Open Source Firmware Release 4.11
Signing Key with following fingerprint:

    0A8E 0CDC 16E1 EDC8 C8E2  09D1 15B7 A4BC 249E 3AD6

8. The PC Engines firmware versions beginning from v4.0.30 and v4.11.0.1
are being signed with PC Engines Open Source Firmware Release 4.11 Signing
Key unless a new official coreboot release is announced. New coreboot
release should follow a new key generation, which public signature should
be available on 3mdeb-secpack repository.


Disclaimers and notes
----------------------

We would like to remind you that PC Engines firmware is being released
under the assumption that all relevant infrastructure is permanently
compromised.  This means that we assume NO trust in any of the servers
or services which host or provide any PC Engines firmware-related data,
in particular, firmware updates, source code repositories, and firmware
downloads.

This canary scheme is not infallible. Although signing the declaration
makes it very difficult for a third party to produce arbitrary
declarations, it does not prevent them from using force or other
means, like blackmail or compromising the signers' laptops, to coerce
us to produce false declarations.

The news feeds quoted below (Proof of freshness) serves to demonstrate
that this canary could not have been created prior to the date stated.
It shows that a series of canaries was not created in advance.

This declaration is merely a best effort and is provided without any
guarantee or warranty. It is not legally binding in any way to
anybody. None of the signers should be ever held legally responsible
for any of the statements made here.

Footnotes
----------

[1] This file should be signed in two ways: (1) via detached PGP
signatures by each of the signers, distributed together with this
canary in the 3mdeb-secpack.git repo, and (2) via digital signatures
on the corresponding 3mdeb-secpack.git repo tags. [2]

digital signatures!
