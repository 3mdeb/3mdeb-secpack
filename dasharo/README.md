GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

## Work with release signing key

Three types of operations can be done with generated key. We can:

* export public key for verification purposes,
* use it to sign a release image,
* use along others public keys to verify release image.

### Exporting public key

After receiving the new key, signed with the public part of the key that you
have access to, please follow these steps to share the public part of new
release key by adding it to this, 3mdeb-secpack, repository.

* Decrypt new key

```
$ gpg --output <new-release-key-name>-priv.asc --decrypt <new-release-key-name>-priv.asc.gpg
gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID 4AFAF0F5030D9986
gpg: encrypted with 4096-bit RSA key, ID 9CCACA8E3F071202, created 2021-09-07
      "Name Name (key-name) <name.name@3mdeb.com>"
```

* Import private key locally

```
$ gpg --import <new-release-key-name>-priv.asc
gpg: key 9CEA8904377B8F3D: 1 signature not checked due to a missing key
gpg: key 9CEA8904377B8F3D: public key "<public-key-name>" imported
gpg: key 9CEA8904377B8F3D: secret key imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
gpg:       secret keys read: 1
gpg:   secret keys imported: 1
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
```

* Export public key

```
$ gpg --output <new-release-key-name>-pub.asc --export -a "<public-key-name>"
$ cat <new-release-key-name>-pub.asc
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

lZSo4cm/iZxp+Uv1BdBwI8Qy0hJMLw9hmaIY0nET+Ik=
=mpVm
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

* Create new PR and add public key (file `<new-release-key-name>-pub.asc`) to
  the repository, similar to
  [previous](https://github.com/3mdeb/3mdeb-secpack/pull/63) PRs

### Signing release image

To sign release image, please use imported private release signing key to create
signature. Commands below assumes, that private key is already imported, as
shown in previous [section](#exporting-public-key).

* Create hash of release image

```
$ sha256sum <release-image> <release-image>.sha256
$ cat <release-image>.sha256
7c50c01a7402a6c6c911061faf9bba5161edae27577168ea94969c0159b2e77f    <release-image>
```

* Create signature, use public key exported in previous
  [section](#exporting-public-key).

```
$ gpg --local-user "<public-key-name>" --output <release-image>.sha256.sig --armor --detach-sig <release-image>.sha256
```

### Verifying release image

Every new release image key is created with chain of keys. In case of Dasharo
release keys those are:

* `3mdeb Master Key`,
* `3mdeb Dasharo Master Key`.

Public parts of those will be needed to fully verify created signature along
with public part of new key, release image with signature and hash.

* Place release image, signature and hash in one directory

```
$ ls <release-image>*
<release-image>  <release-image>.sha256  <release-image>.sha256.sig
```

* Verify hash

```<public-key-name>
$ sha256sum -c <release-image>.sha256
<release-image>: OK
```

* Fetch public keys

```
