# 3mdeb Security Pack

This git repository was inspired  by the
[Qubes Security Pack](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-secpack) and is a central
place for all security-related information about the 3mdeb projects. It includes
the following:

* 3mdeb customers PGP keys (`customer-keys/`) - keys managed by 3mdeb on
   behalf of our customers, typically we use those keys for binaries signing
* Dasharo keys (`dasharo/`) - Dasharo Master Key used to sign Dasharo keys
   related to market segments (Secure Firewall, Workstation), as well as
   Dasharo market segment firmware release signing keys, to read more about
   Dasharo visit [website](https://dasharo.com/) and
   [documentation](https://docs.dasharo.com/)
* 3mdeb PGP keys (`keys/`)
    - `employees-keys` -  3mdeb employees keys signed according to org chart,
     chain of signatures end with `owner-key` signature
    - `master-key` - 3mdeb Master Key signs all keys dedicated to given purpose
     e.g. Open Source Software Release Signing Key, Open Source Firmware
     Release Signing Key and others
    - `owner-key` - 3mdeb Owner Key
* 3mdeb Open Source Firmware Master Key (`open-source-firmware/`) - key used
   to sign firmware releases produced by 3mdeb
* 3mdeb Open Source Software Master Key (`open-source-software/`) - key used
   to sign software releases produced by 3mdeb
* Supporting scripts (`scripts/`)

The files contained in this repository can be verified in two ways:

* By verifying the git commit tags (`git tag -v`)
* By verifying the detached PGP signatures, which are provided for the majority
   of files included here

All the keys used by the 3mdeb projects, including the keys used to sign files
and commits in this repository, are signed by the 3mdeb owner Piotr Kr√≥l
(`E0309B2D85A67E846329E34BB2EE71E967AA9E4C`, [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/pietrushnic)).

Even though this key is also included in this repo, you should make sure to
obtain the key fingerprint via some other channel, as you can be sure
that if you were getting a falsified 3mdeb Security Pack it would contain a
falsified owner key as well.

## git-secrets setup

Below configuration would prevent you from accidentaly commiting private keys
into the repository.

* Install [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) via one of the
  supported installation options

* Add pre-commit hooks to this repo:

```shell
$ git secrets --install
$ git secrets --add 'PRIVATE[[:space:]]KEY'
```

* Trying to commit private key would result in following message:

```shell
FILE_NAME:1:-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
FILE_NAME:118:-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----

[ERROR] Matched one or more prohibited patterns

Possible mitigations:
- Mark false positives as allowed using: git config --add secrets.allowed ...
- Mark false positives as allowed by adding regular expressions to .gitallowed at repository's root directory
- List your configured patterns: git config --get-all secrets.patterns
- List your configured allowed patterns: git config --get-all secrets.allowed
- List your configured allowed patterns in .gitallowed at repository's root directory
- Use --no-verify if this is a one-time false positive
```

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
